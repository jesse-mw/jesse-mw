Hey folx ðŸ‘‹

I'm Jesse, a full-stack engineer who leans heavily towards creativity and co-creating joy.  

I've worked in remote and autonomous roles for the last five years.  
I'm growing as a lead engineer, with a tech stack that aims at simple: NextJS & Supabase  
  
Stuff I'm working on ...  
&nbsp;&nbsp;- Being a founding engineer intending to solve a wide-scale financial problem.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;- Writing a sci-fi novel about a revolutionary's past encroaching upon his present.  

I believe less is more - I value an intentionally slow pace.  
  
Humans first.
