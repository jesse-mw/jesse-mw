Hey folx ðŸ‘‹

I'm Jesse, a full-stack engineer/architect  
  who leans heavily towards creativity and co-creating joy  
  with a tech stack that's simple yet powerful: NextJS & Supabase/PostgreSQL.

Currently, I'm...
 - An architectural engineer helping rebuild an author's product.
 - An author telling a sci-fi story about a revolutionary's past encroaching upon his present.
 - Open to consultation roles with companies solving human-centric problems.

Humans first.
