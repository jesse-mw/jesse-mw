### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: they/them

- ðŸ’­ Stuff I'm working on ...
[Exploding Kittens](https://www.explodingkittens.com/) as a Full Stack Engineer
[Success Fish](https://success.fish/) (coming soon) as a Founder
(no link yet, secret-ish project) as an Author 

- ðŸ’¡ Things I'm usually thinking about ...
1. We're sending casuals to space during our lifetime. 
2. When it's reasonable to send five ogres at my players.
3. Crypto FOMO is such a weird experience.

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ...
1. Worldwide impact stories - none of that "my POS system will..." and more of that "we're 3D printing entire neighborhoods".
2. Quick calls to consult on success. (message me on [Instagram @ success.fish](https://www.instagram.com/success.fish/) - I know it's empty).
