1. ðŸ’­ Stuff I'm working on ...  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- <a href="https://www.explodingkittens.com/" target="_blank">Exploding Kittens</a> as a Full Stack Engineer  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- <a href="https://success.fish/" target="_blank">Success Fish</a> (coming soon) as a Founder  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- (no link yet, secret-ish project) as an Author  

  
2. ðŸ’¡ Things I'm usually thinking about ...  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- We're sending casuals to space during our lifetime.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- When it's reasonable to send five ogres at my players.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Crypto FOMO is such a weird experience.  
  
3. ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ...  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Worldwide impact stories - none of that "my POS system will..." and more of that "we're 3D printing entire neighborhoods".  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Quick calls to consult on success. (message me on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/success.fish/" target="_blank">Instagram @ success.fish</a> - I know it's empty).
