Hey folx ðŸ‘‹

I'm Jesse, a full-stack engineer who leans heavily towards creativity and co-creating joy.

With five years in remote and autonomous roles, I've grown as a lead engineer with a tech stack that's simple yet powerful: NextJS & Supabase/PostgreSQL.

Currently, I'm...
  - A founding engineer working to solve a wide-scale financial problem.
  - An author telling a sci-fi story about a revolutionary's past encroaching upon his present.

I also offer...
  - One-on-one coaching for newer-to-the-field software engineers. 
  - Technical consulting services to businesses in need of expertise in NextJS and PostgreSQL.

I believe less is more - I value an intentionally slow pace.

Humans first.
