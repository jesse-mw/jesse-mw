### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: they/them

1. ðŸ’­ Stuff I'm working on ...
  - [Exploding Kittens](https://www.explodingkittens.com/) as a Full Stack Engineer
  - [Success Fish](https://success.fish/) (coming soon) as a Founder
  - (no link yet, secret-ish project) as an Author 

2. ðŸ’¡ Things I'm usually thinking about ...
  - We're sending casuals to space during our lifetime. 
  - When it's reasonable to send five ogres at my players.
  - Crypto FOMO is such a weird experience.

3. ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ...
  - Worldwide impact stories - none of that "my POS system will..." and more of that "we're 3D printing entire neighborhoods".
  - Quick calls to consult on success. (message me on [Instagram @ success.fish](https://www.instagram.com/success.fish/) - I know it's empty).
