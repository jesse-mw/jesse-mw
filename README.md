![branded header image](./header.jpg "Hey there friend!")  
I'm a full-stack engineer who leans heavily towards creativity and co-creating joy.  
I've worked in remote and autonomous roles for the last five years.  
Stuff I'm working on ...  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Being a founding engineer intending to solve a wide-scale financial problem.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm growing as a lead engineer, with a tech stack that aims at simple: NextJS & Supabase  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Writing a sci-fi novel about a revolutionary's past encroaching upon his present.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a world where technology is strictly regulated, an accountant with a violent past finds himself embroiled in a new conflict as old ghosts resurface and refuse to rest.  
I believe less is more - I value an intentionally slow pace.  
  
Humans first.
