Hey folx ðŸ‘‹

I'm Jesse, a full-stack engineer who leans heavily towards creativity and co-creating joy.

With over five years in remote and autonomous roles, I've grown as a lead engineer with a tech stack that's simple yet powerful: NextJS & Supabase/PostgreSQL.

Currently, I'm...
 - A founding engineer working to solve a wide-scale financial problem.
 - An author telling a sci-fi story about a revolutionary's past encroaching upon his present.
 - Open to consultation roles with companies solving human-centric problems.

Humans first.
